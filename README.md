This is still a work in progress. This only works with global-beta. Do NOT attempt to use this while the official version is running. It will not work.

# Usage
Download a build from Releases. Then, download the executable's module [veritas](https://github.com/hessiser/veritas) and place in the root directory of the executable. This module will need to be downloaded almost every patch. 

1. Run the game.

2. In the executable's menubar, click `Toolsâ†’Spawn Server`.

3. Enter battle in-game and press `Ctrl+M` to toggle. Damage should now be logging and visualizations (graphs) updating accordingly.
